# LeetCode Practice

A repository dedicated to tracking my progress and solutions for LeetCode problems.

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to improve algorithmic thinking and coding proficiency through consistent practice.

## Directory Structure
Solutions are organized by difficulty, with each problem having its own directory:
```
{difficulty}/
└── {problem-slug}/
    ├── src/
    │   └── main.rs  (or other language files)
    └── memo.md      (notes and complexity analysis)
```
Example:
`easy/two-sum/src/main.rs`
`easy/two-sum/memo.md`
